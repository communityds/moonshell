# PROFILES
#
# As with files in /etc/profile.d, profile files in Moonshell should be used to
# define variables and other less dynamic things. Functions should not reside
# here, but if they do, they must work outside of a moonshell initialised
# environment. Handy things to define in etc/profile.d/private:
#   * AWS_ACCOUNTS[@]
#   * AWS_REGION

# scripts and functions tab completable; which aids productivity and ease of
