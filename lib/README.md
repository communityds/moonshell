# Bash Libraries

## common.sh

Handy functions for ones bash environment.

## complete.sh

Bash tab completion is the duck's nuts, bee's knees and dogs bollocks.

These functions create completion functions for each app.

## cred.sh

WIP

## environment.sh

This creates handy 'environment' functions to make switching between and using
an environment easy. An environment can contain multiple git repositories and
need special functions etc.; this is a key part of the magic.

## moon.sh

Functions for Moonshell self management

## private.sh

Some functions, aliases, etc. I do not want to be version controlled. Those
private libraries reside in the $PWD/private dir.
